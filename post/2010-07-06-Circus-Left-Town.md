#Circus Left Town

1990年3月30日，Eric Clapton四岁的儿子不幸从纽约的数十层公寓阳台跌出意外死亡。E.C.将痛苦的思念寄予一曲《Tears in  Heaven》。次年E.C.的《Unplugged》现场，演唱了一首《Circus Left  Town》，整首曲子的节奏稳稳的流畅，E.C.的演唱无比忧伤，特别是那句歌词“and it's sad, so sad"。这首歌也是怀念他儿子而写，就在儿子出事的前一天，他还带着儿子去了马戏团。《Circus Left  Town》并没有收录在《Unplugged》专辑，如果你有现场的，可以听到这首曲子。E.C.的一生是个传奇，30岁从5年的毒瘾中走了出来，重新做音乐灌唱片，此后开始布鲁斯音乐创作，取得成绩就不废话了。

Little man with his eyes on fire 

And his smile so bright. 

In his hands are the toys you gave 

To fill his heart with delight. 

And in the ring stands a circus clown 

Holding up a knife. 

What you see and what you will hear 

Will last you for the rest of your life. 

And it's sad, so sad, 

There ain't no easy way round. 

And it's sad, so sad, 

All you friends gather round 

'Cause the circus left town. 

Little man with his heart so pure 

And his love so fine. 

Stick with me and I'll ride with you 

Till the end of the line. 

Hold my hand and I'll walk with you 

Through the darkest night. 

And when I smile I'll be thinking of you 

And every little thing will be all right. 

Chorus...

Chorus...

The circus left town, left town. 

The circus left town, left town.
